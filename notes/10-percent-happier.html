  <h1>10% Happier</h1>
<p>by: Dan Harris
<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/10-Happier-Self-Help-Actually-Works/dp/0062265431/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1497726189&amp;sr=8-1">(buy)</a></p>

<p>Dan Harris had a breakdown on live television, while delivering the news. The book describes the events leading up to this event and what he did to get better - use meditation. Apart from the <em>education</em> of the book, the stories of his career in journalism and broadcasting were also really interesting. I highlighted a lot of sections that had to do with TV and being on camera and also his interactions with other veteran journalists, like Peter Jennings.</p>

<p>He’s also pretty funny, so I make note of these things too:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">lol</code> In some places I cleaned up the dialogue (excising uhms and ahs, etc) to make it more readable, or to make myself look smarter.</p>

<p>He starts off the book going into detail about what happened on-air and how his career in journalism got started.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found the craft itself fascinating - especially the challenge of writing stories that were meant to be spoken aloud and matched to pictures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peter Jennings was his mentor. He had “bottomless fear” and was a “colossus” at ABC News. I was surprised to find out that Jennings had a “volcanic temper”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Working for Peter was like sticking your head in a lion’s mouth: thirlling, but not particularly safe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peter’s standards were not arbitrary. He cared deeply about his work and saw his job as a privilege – a sacred trust with the audience.</p>

<p>Dan’s Dad: “The price of security is insecurity”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my view, the balance between stress and contentment was life’s biggest riddle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>White House reporter Helen Thomas, one I embraced with gusto: You’re only as good as your last story</p>

<p>Competition was fierce:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I set up an endless mental tape loop: How many stories have I had on this week? What is the state of my relationship with Peter right now? What else do I have coming up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the topic of 9/11:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A guy in front of the passenger cabin hung up his cell phone, turned around and told everyone that the Twin Towers were on fire. It was September 11, 2001 and suddenly every civilian airplane in the country was grounded.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I knew Peter would be in his element, in full-on clarity-and-comfort mode, and it made me physically ill not being part of the team reporting on - and explaining - this news to the country</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On being a war correspondant:</p>

<p>A call from the foreign desk and he’s needed in Pakistan. “This fittingly was how I began the most dangerous and formative years of my life: with a series of douchey gesticulations”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trip was my first taste of what I would describe as journalistic heroin: the pure, sick rush of being somewhere you’re not supposed to be and not only getting away with it but also getting it on TV. I was hooked.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I liked being a war correspondant. Loved it, in fact. The bodyguards, the armored cars, being driven around like I was a head of state. I also liked the way the flak jackets made my diminuative frame look larger on TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots of competition in the world of news, between journalists. “..it was also stressful..way too many hours measuring myself against others”</p>
