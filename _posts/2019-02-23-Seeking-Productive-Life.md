This is a fascinating blog post from Stephen Wolfram on his _Personal Infrastructure_ and how he organizes himself. I find that I'm always on the lookout for better ways to be organized, whether it's new software to keep files and other data organized or a better way to store physical documents. I can be a bit obsessive about it. 

> I believe I first thought seriously about how to organize my files back in 1978 ... And over the past 40 years I’ve basically gone through five generations of filesystem organization, with each generation basically being a reflection of how I’m organizing my work at that stage in my life.

I did love, and can certainly relate, to his comment about connecting to projectors:

> And it’s amazing how random it is. In places where one can’t imagine the projector is going to work, it’ll be just fine. And in places where one can’t imagine it won’t work, it’ll fail horribly.
