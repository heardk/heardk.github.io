I took a recent trip to San Francisco, following my wife as she was attending a conference. I've been there before, but took the time to get out and take some pictures of landmarks I hadn't had time to photograph last time. Photographs of the Golden Gate bridge are not new, but I wanted one of my own.

I spent a good part of one day at Baker Beach trying to get the shot you see here. And as you can also see, the weather wasn't exactly the greatest, but still turned out to be a half-way decent shot.
