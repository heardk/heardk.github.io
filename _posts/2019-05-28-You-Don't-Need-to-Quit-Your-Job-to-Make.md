I'm always in need of a good reminder that browsing social media, watching YouTube or Netflix does not contribute to goals of _making_ something. The risk of our need to decompress after a long day at work can turn into an entire evening of watching Netflix.

But if your goal is to one day become an entrepreneur, a significant portion of “me time” should be invested in getting there since it won’t happen on its own. “Me time” shouldn’t just be non-tiring activity, but anything that helps an individual get to the future state that they wish to be in.
