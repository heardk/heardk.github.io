<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Triple the number of ideas you generate</li>
  <li>Procrastinate strategically - stop in the middle of idea generation/writing/brainstorming to engage divergent thinking giving ideas time to incubate</li>
  <li>Make your ideas more familiar - Repeat yourself, mix new ideas in with other ideas to get people more familiar when trying to socialize. Like Lion King script was framed as Hamlet with Lions</li>
  <li>Don't try to calm down - if you're nervous turn anxiety into intense positive emotions like interest and enthusiasm</li>
  <li>Stop assigning devil's advocates and start unearthing them - Differing opinions are useful even if they are wrong, but only effective if authentic and consistent, like someone who actually thinks differently</li>
  <li>Welcome Criticism - Seek out criticism and make public if necessary</li>
  <li>Emphasize values over rules - Rules set limits, while values encourage children (and everyone else) to internalize principles for themselves.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Journalism</h3>
<p>
<p>He starts off the book going into detail about what happened on-air and how his career in journalism got started.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found the craft itself fascinating - especially the challenge of writing stories that were meant to be spoken aloud and matched to pictures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peter Jennings was his mentor. He had "bottomless fear" and was a "colossus" at ABC News. I was surprised to find out that Jennings had a "volcanic temper".</p>

<p>Peter's standards were not arbitrary. He cared deeply about his work and saw his job as a privilege – a sacred trust with the audience.</p>

<p>Lots of competition in the world of news, between journalists. "..it was also stressful..way too many hours measuring myself against others"</p>

</p>
<h3>Covering 9/11</h3>
<p>
<p>On the topic of 9/11:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A guy in front of the passenger cabin hung up his cell phone, turned around and told everyone that the Twin Towers were on fire. It was September 11, 2001 and suddenly every civilian airplane in the country was grounded.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I knew Peter would be in his element, in full-on clarity-and-comfort mode, and it made me physically ill not being part of the team reporting on - and explaining - this news to the country</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I liked being a war correspondent. Loved it, in fact. The bodyguards, the armored cars, being driven around like I was a head of state. I also liked the way the flak jackets made my diminutive frame look larger on TV.</p>
</blockquote>

</p>
<h3>Breakdown</h3>
<p>
<p>Dan Harris had a breakdown on live television, while delivering the news. The book describes the events leading up to this event and what he did to get better - use meditation. Apart from the <em>education</em> of the book, the stories of his career in journalism and broadcasting were also really interesting. I highlighted a lot of sections that had to do with TV and being on camera and also his interactions with other veteran journalists, like Peter Jennings</p>

<h3>Saturday Meeting</h3>
<p>
<p>Saturday morning meetings were a regular thing. You can't ask a store associate to work and not have management working too. All regional managers and executive would take part in this giant morning meeting on a Saturday. They'd do crazy cheers too. Sometimes democratic, sometimes dictatorial but mostly rallies the troops and most wouldn't even think about missing a Saturday meeting.</p>

</p>
<h3>Store Sizes</h3>
<p>
<p>They had 5 different store sizes, from 30,000 to 60,000 sq ft
1970 - 32 stores - $31M in sales
1976 - 125 stores - $340M in sales
1980 - 276 stores - $1.2B in sales
1990 - 1528 stores - $26B in sales</p>

</p>
<h3>Stores with a recorder</h3>
<p>
<p>Sam would go into other stores with his pad of paper and recorder and ask a bunch of questions about how they were doing things:</p>

<p>I remember going into their stores - I bet I've been in more Kmarts than anybody - and I would really envy their merchandise mix and the way they presented it. So much in their stores were superior to ours back then that sometimes I felt like we couldn't compete.</p>

</p>
<h3>Shrinkage</h3>
<p>
<p>Shrinkage: unaccounted-for inventory losses usually caused by theft. Helen (Sam's wife) would often just take things from the first store if she needed something. Didn't even think about paying for it back then. Says that was bad business</p>

<p>1980 - introduced a shrink incentive plan to help curb theft and shared profits with the store that was able to get below the company's goal. Each associate got $200 when this happened.</p>

</p>
<h3>First Store in Newport</h3>
<p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I drew up a plan, bought a sign, bought fixtures from a company in Nebraska and bought merchandise .. whatever I thought I could sell. Charlie Baum …. helped me put it together .. he was the most efficient layer-outer I've ever known.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Early days, managers were hired as limited partners and were asked if they wanted to invest in the store. If the store had cost $50K and the manager invested $1K, he owned 2%</p>

</p>
<h3>Selling at 20% Discount</h3>
<p>
<p>We were trying to find out if customers in a town of 6000 come to our kind of barn and buy the same merchandise strictly because of price. The answer is yes.</p>

</p>
<h3>Customers</h3>
<p>
<p>Grow your business without losing touch with the customer - think small. Because sales keep going up doesn't mean we're smarter than anyone else or because we're so big we can make it happen, it's because our customers are supporting us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some folks have a tendency to build up big staffs around them to emphasize their own importance and we don't need any of that at Wal-Mart… When we're thinking small that's another thing we're on the lookout for: big egos.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>From this day forward, I solemnly promise and declare that every time a customer comes within 10 ft of me, I will smile, look him in the eye and greet him. So help me Sam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of a Greeter was born around 1980 and was the result of a store manager trying to stop merchandise from being stolen and decided to put someone at the front door to watch for that, but also found out that they could greet customers as well. - Crowly, Louisiana</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we can get within 5% of the same price and quality, we take a smaller markup and go with the American product</p>
</blockquote>

</p>
<h3>Buyer NYC</h3>
<p>
<p>A story about how he worked with a buyer in NYC, Harry Weiner, and was able to get ladies panties for $2.00 a dozen vs $2.50 from somewhere else. At the new price he could sell them as a promotion for 4 for a $1.00. He wasn't making as much money but could sell three times as many</p>

</p>
<h3>10 Rules</h3>
<p>
<p>On 10 Rules that worked for Sam:
Rule 4 - Communicate everything you possibly can to your partners (employees)
Rule 7 - Listen to everyone in your company and figure out ways to get them talking
Rule 10 - SWIM UPSTREAM, go the other way. Ignore conventional wisdom</p>

</p>
<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>I was struck by how down to earth and uncomplicated he came across in the book. At times I would even say <em>folksy</em></li>
  <li>A lot of what I pulled from the book was interesting terms or processes he used while building Wal-Mart (now Walmart), specifically around merchandising and discounting</li>
  <li>The book was published just after he died in 1992 - a long time ago in retail. Need to keep that in mind while reading</li>
  <li>He was pretty defensive at times, about how or why he did things the way he did. Mentioning how he was criticized for running his business. I don't remember this at the time, but I was a lot younger when this was going on</li>
</ul>
