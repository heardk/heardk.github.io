<div id="dialogrecqvaKtAz9JMAZhp" style="display: none;">
<h3>Municode</h3>
<p>
<p>It was simply easier for city builders in communities with modest budgets to repeat woodwork before, and their habits gradually hardened into the building and Zoning codes that dictated how new places would be built. The segregated land zoning System created to keep industry from creeping into an Ohio Village back in 1926 evolved into a national tool and eventually was distilled into standard downloadable codes sold by the private online purveyor municode.</p>

</p>
<h3>Law of Sprawl</h3>
<p>
<p>You cannot build the kind of apartments above shops that you see in Paris or Copenhagen, or in any of North America's best-loved neighborhoods, because County codes strictly segregate the various functions of the city on two separate Parcels of land.</p>

<p>Everything has its place far from everything else.</p>

<p>Most American municipalities take the easy route and simply adopt their code from Unicode the generic online source</p>

<p>Every level of government offers incentives for sprawl style development and penalties for smart growth, sometimes without even knowing it.</p>

<p>Then there is the US government's accelerated depreciation tax deduction, which gives developers a generous tax break for creating new buildings rather than renovating or reusing old ones.</p>

</p>
<h3>Danger</h3>
<p>
<p>If the goal is to avoid being hurt or killed by strangers, then the edge neighborhood is a terrible choice.</p>

<p>Someone who walks at her door on the edges of sprawl Suburbia is much more likely to die at the hands of a Stranger Than someone moving through most American Central cities or inner suburbs. The only difference is that most of Suburbia is Killers didn't mean it. Haha</p>

</p>
<h3>Income vs Happiness</h3>
<p>
<p>Dubbed the evolutionary happiness function, the equation explains the psychological process that both fuels our desire for bigger homes and insurers that we will be dissatisfied shortly after moving in.</p>

<p>A person with a one-hour commute has to earn 40% more money to be a satisfied with life as someone who walks to the office.</p>

<p>Most of the Boost you feel from a leap on the income ladder simply of operates within a year. The Finish Line shifts.</p>

</p>
<h3>Sprawl</h3>
<p>
<p>Sprawl, as an urban form was laid out, massively subsidized, and legally mandated long before anyone actually decided to buy a house there. It is as much the results of zoning, legislation, and lobbying as a crowded city block. It did not occur naturally. It was designed.</p>

<p>These neighborhoods accomplish several historic feats. They take up more space per person, and they are more expensive to build and operate than any Urban form Ever constructed. They require more roads for every resident, and more water pipes, more sewers more power cables, utility wiring, sidewalks, signposts, and Landscaping.</p>

<p>They cost more for municipalities to maintain. It cost more to protect with Emergency Services. They pollute more and pour more carbon into the atmosphere. In short, the dispersed city is the most expensive, resource intense, land gobbling, polluting way of living ever built.</p>

</p>
<h3>Zoning</h3>
<p>
<p>Zoning was intended to reduce congestion, improve health and make business more efficient. But most of all, it protected property values. Perhaps this is why we so enthusiastically embraced it.</p>

<p>Most powerfully, they strictly separate places for living, working, shopping, and Recreation functional segregation was built into almost every new suburb after World War II.</p>

<p>The tactic still works today. If you want to keep poor people out of your community, all you need to do is Ban duplexes and apartment buildings, which is exactly what new suburbs were permitted to do.</p>

<p>That's, an allegedly government hating people have embraced an entirely new layer of government.</p>

</p>
<h3>Streets</h3>
<p>
<p>Anyone can use the street and everyone did. It was a chaotic environment littered with horse dung and fraught with speeding carriages, but a messy kind of freedom rained.</p>

<h2 id="cars-and-trucks-begin-to-push-their-way-onto-the-streets">Cars and trucks begin to push their way onto the streets.</h2>

<p>In the 1920s more than 2,000 people were killed in motor accidents in the United States that decade. Most were killed in cities. Most of the Dead were pedestrians. Half were children and youths.</p>

<p>Auto Club's begin to compete directly with Urban safety council's, campaigning to redirect the blame for accidents from car drivers to pedestrians. Crossing the street freely got a pejorative name jaywalking and became a crime.</p>

<p>A Company formed by GM, Firestone, Phillips petroleum, and standard oil was busy buying up and dismantling hundreds of private streetcar lines in dozens of cities across the United States. Various conspiracy theories have argued that this was a plan to force people to buy cars by eliminating public transit. This may have been true but it was hardly necessary. The streetcar had been fatally wounded when the definition of the street changed. It drowned in a sea of cars.</p>

</p>
<h3>Happy City</h3>
<p>
<p>It's about getting up every day and working very hard to our goals that make your life meaningful, sometimes in ways that are not all conducive to short-term contentment.</p>

<p>It's about the realization of talent and potential, and the feeling that you're able to make the most of your abilities in life.</p>

<p>The good city should be measured not only by its distractions and amenities but also by how it affects this everyday drama of survival, work, and meaning.</p>

</p>
<h3>A basic recipe for urban happiness</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>The city should strive to maximize joy and minimize hardship</li>
  <li>It should lead us toward Health rather than sickness</li>
  <li>It should offer as real freedom to live, move, and build our lives as we wish</li>
  <li>It should build resilience against economically or environmental shocks</li>
  <li>It should be fair and the way it apportions space, Services, Mobility, Joys, hardships and costs</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of all, it should enable us to build and strengthen the bonds between friends, families, and strangers that give life meaning, bonds that represent the city's greatest achievement and opportunity</p>

<p>The city that acknowledges and celebrates our common fate, that opens doors to empathy and cooperation, will help us tackle the great challenges of the century</p>

<p>It is audacious to believe that the city might build happiness just by changing its shape.</p>

</p>
<h3>Trees</h3>
<p>
<p>Buildings that looked out on trees and grass experienced about half the violent crime level of buildings that looked out on Barron Courtyards. This is especially remarkable given the fact that criminologists have pointed out that bushes and trees provide convenient cover for illicit activity.</p>

<p>A study of Los Angeles revealed that people who live in areas with more parks are more helpful and trusting them people who don't, regardless of their income or race.</p>

</p>
<h3>Lost wallet return rate</h3>
<p>
<p>Survey respondents rate the likelihood of a stranger returning their lost wallet at only about 25% but an experiment in Toronto found that among real strangers the likelihood of return was better than 80%</p>

<p>What numbers are independent, just as most people's perception of safety has more to do with the plenitude of graffiti than the density of purse Snatchers</p>

</p>
<h3>Popular Cities</h3>
<p>
<p>The sad part is that a place is popularity can actually destroy the elements that contribute to happiness. The more we flock to high-status cities for the good life money opportunity novelty, the more crowded, expensive, polluted, and congested those places become.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Triple the number of ideas you generate</li>
  <li>Procrastinate strategically - stop in the middle of idea generation/writing/brainstorming to engage divergent thinking giving ideas time to incubate</li>
  <li>Make your ideas more familiar - Repeat yourself, mix new ideas in with other ideas to get people more familiar when trying to socialize. Like Lion King script was framed as Hamlet with Lions</li>
  <li>Don't try to calm down - if you're nervous turn anxiety into intense positive emotions like interest and enthusiasm</li>
  <li>Stop assigning devil's advocates and start unearthing them - Differing opinions are useful even if they are wrong, but only effective if authentic and consistent, like someone who actually thinks differently</li>
  <li>Welcome Criticism - Seek out criticism and make public if necessary</li>
  <li>Emphasize values over rules - Rules set limits, while values encourage children (and everyone else) to internalize principles for themselves.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Journalism</h3>
<p>
<p>He starts off the book going into detail about what happened on-air and how his career in journalism got started.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found the craft itself fascinating - especially the challenge of writing stories that were meant to be spoken aloud and matched to pictures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peter Jennings was his mentor. He had "bottomless fear" and was a "colossus" at ABC News. I was surprised to find out that Jennings had a "volcanic temper".</p>

<p>Peter's standards were not arbitrary. He cared deeply about his work and saw his job as a privilege – a sacred trust with the audience.</p>

<p>Lots of competition in the world of news, between journalists. "..it was also stressful..way too many hours measuring myself against others"</p>

</p>
<h3>Covering 9/11</h3>
<p>
<p>On the topic of 9/11:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A guy in front of the passenger cabin hung up his cell phone, turned around and told everyone that the Twin Towers were on fire. It was September 11, 2001 and suddenly every civilian airplane in the country was grounded.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I knew Peter would be in his element, in full-on clarity-and-comfort mode, and it made me physically ill not being part of the team reporting on - and explaining - this news to the country</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I liked being a war correspondent. Loved it, in fact. The bodyguards, the armored cars, being driven around like I was a head of state. I also liked the way the flak jackets made my diminutive frame look larger on TV.</p>
</blockquote>

</p>
<h3>Breakdown</h3>
<p>
<p>Dan Harris had a breakdown on live television, while delivering the news. The book describes the events leading up to this event and what he did to get better - use meditation. Apart from the <em>education</em> of the book, the stories of his career in journalism and broadcasting were also really interesting. I highlighted a lot of sections that had to do with TV and being on camera and also his interactions with other veteran journalists, like Peter Jennings</p>

<h3>Saturday Meeting</h3>
<p>
<p>Saturday morning meetings were a regular thing. You can't ask a store associate to work and not have management working too. All regional managers and executive would take part in this giant morning meeting on a Saturday. They'd do crazy cheers too. Sometimes democratic, sometimes dictatorial but mostly rallies the troops and most wouldn't even think about missing a Saturday meeting.</p>

</p>
<h3>Store Sizes</h3>
<p>
<p>They had 5 different store sizes, from 30,000 to 60,000 sq ft
1970 - 32 stores - $31M in sales
1976 - 125 stores - $340M in sales
1980 - 276 stores - $1.2B in sales
1990 - 1528 stores - $26B in sales</p>

</p>
<h3>Stores with a recorder</h3>
<p>
<p>Sam would go into other stores with his pad of paper and recorder and ask a bunch of questions about how they were doing things:</p>

<p>I remember going into their stores - I bet I've been in more Kmarts than anybody - and I would really envy their merchandise mix and the way they presented it. So much in their stores were superior to ours back then that sometimes I felt like we couldn't compete.</p>

</p>
<h3>Shrinkage</h3>
<p>
<p>Shrinkage: unaccounted-for inventory losses usually caused by theft. Helen (Sam's wife) would often just take things from the first store if she needed something. Didn't even think about paying for it back then. Says that was bad business</p>

<p>1980 - introduced a shrink incentive plan to help curb theft and shared profits with the store that was able to get below the company's goal. Each associate got $200 when this happened.</p>

</p>
<h3>First Store in Newport</h3>
<p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I drew up a plan, bought a sign, bought fixtures from a company in Nebraska and bought merchandise .. whatever I thought I could sell. Charlie Baum …. helped me put it together .. he was the most efficient layer-outer I've ever known.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Early days, managers were hired as limited partners and were asked if they wanted to invest in the store. If the store had cost $50K and the manager invested $1K, he owned 2%</p>

</p>
<h3>Selling at 20% Discount</h3>
<p>
<p>We were trying to find out if customers in a town of 6000 come to our kind of barn and buy the same merchandise strictly because of price. The answer is yes.</p>

</p>
<h3>Customers</h3>
<p>
<p>Grow your business without losing touch with the customer - think small. Because sales keep going up doesn't mean we're smarter than anyone else or because we're so big we can make it happen, it's because our customers are supporting us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some folks have a tendency to build up big staffs around them to emphasize their own importance and we don't need any of that at Wal-Mart… When we're thinking small that's another thing we're on the lookout for: big egos.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>From this day forward, I solemnly promise and declare that every time a customer comes within 10 ft of me, I will smile, look him in the eye and greet him. So help me Sam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of a Greeter was born around 1980 and was the result of a store manager trying to stop merchandise from being stolen and decided to put someone at the front door to watch for that, but also found out that they could greet customers as well. - Crowly, Louisiana</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we can get within 5% of the same price and quality, we take a smaller markup and go with the American product</p>
</blockquote>

</p>
<h3>Buyer NYC</h3>
<p>
<p>A story about how he worked with a buyer in NYC, Harry Weiner, and was able to get ladies panties for $2.00 a dozen vs $2.50 from somewhere else. At the new price he could sell them as a promotion for 4 for a $1.00. He wasn't making as much money but could sell three times as many</p>

</p>
<h3>10 Rules</h3>
<p>
<p>On 10 Rules that worked for Sam:
Rule 4 - Communicate everything you possibly can to your partners (employees)
Rule 7 - Listen to everyone in your company and figure out ways to get them talking
Rule 10 - SWIM UPSTREAM, go the other way. Ignore conventional wisdom</p>

</p>
<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>I was struck by how down to earth and uncomplicated he came across in the book. At times I would even say <em>folksy</em></li>
  <li>A lot of what I pulled from the book was interesting terms or processes he used while building Wal-Mart (now Walmart), specifically around merchandising and discounting</li>
  <li>The book was published just after he died in 1992 - a long time ago in retail. Need to keep that in mind while reading</li>
